# README - For the original archives directory

This directory houses subdirectories of the original Khan Academy archives. With this project, I originally had a new formatted version of the files and directories, but here, I will reupload them in their original format.

Due to the GitHub 1000 item limit, I have had to split this into multiple directories. You will need to copy them into a separate directory titled `Khan Academy` to see them in their original way (but this isn't required)

It is going to take a while to upload them here.
