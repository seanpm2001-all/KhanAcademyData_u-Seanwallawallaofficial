# `Contributing.md`

I am not allowing contributions on this project, as it is already complete. It just serves as an archive for my old Khan Academy data.
However, there are 2 contributions I am accepting right now:

> * Suggestions on bulk moving directories on GitHub

> * Icon reference files (similar to a custom folder icon INI file for Windows) but for various platforms. Right now, I am looking for KDE, MacOS, and GNOME contributions to the icon reference files.

This project is already pretty much complete other than these 2 things.

File version:  `1 (Tuesday, June 9th 2020 at 6:10 pm)`
