# My March 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of March 2020.

March 2020 is my 35th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on the (unknown_unit) I need to look back into my notes to see what I did this month

It spans from day 1007 to day 1037. Some unique milestones were reached, they include:

> * Day 1010 - Binary

> * Day 1011 - Also binary

> * Day 1024 - 2^10 (It is also a Base 2/10, I need a cheat sheet for base 2 and base 10, I constantly get 1000 and 1024 mixed up when searching for bases, just note I am referring to the base system where 1024 bytes is a kilobyte)
