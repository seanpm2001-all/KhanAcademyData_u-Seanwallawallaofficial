It spans from day 1159 to day 1189. no significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month. They include:

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 2 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution.2 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before.

3. Starting on July 20th 2020, the mobile screenshots folder was renamed from `mobile` to `cellular` to be more technical, as my laptop is mobile as well. This didn't take effect for the directory structure until this month

4. Starting on August 20th 2020, after an issue with OneDrive, I began using actual zipping software to make the Khan Academy cellular zip archives. So starting on August 20th 2020, cellular Khan Academy zip archives are compressed (originally, they were just OneDrive uploads and downloads, and OneDrive doesn't compress zip files)

5. No other notes for this month
