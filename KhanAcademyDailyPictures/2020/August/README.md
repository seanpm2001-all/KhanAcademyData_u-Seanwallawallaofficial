## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 2 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution.2 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before.

3. Starting on July 20th 2020, the mobile screenshots folder was renamed from `mobile` to `cellular` to be more technical, as my laptop is mobile as well. This didn't take effect for the directory structure until this month

4. No other notes for this month
