# My July 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of July 2020.

July 2020 is my 39th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I continued to work on World History for the entire month, making it through the second wave civilizations chapter and starting the medievel/middle ages chapter.

It spans from day 1129 to day 1158. No significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month.

I got daily Khan Academy screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early last this month:

> Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. This month, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before.

I got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and I switched on day 1, I was going to wait a week, but it was working fine, and I really wanted to get away from Windows 10.

As a result, the quality of desktop screenshots has gotten close to nearly doubling, going from 1366x738 to 1920x1200 (from 738p to 1200p)
