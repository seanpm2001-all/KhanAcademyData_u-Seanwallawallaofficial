# My July 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of July 2020.

July 2020 is my 39th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I continued to work on World History for the entire month, making it through the second wave civilizations chapter (600 BCE - 600 CE) and starting the medieval/middle ages chapter (600 CE - 1450 CE) and also finishing the medieval/middle ages chapter and starting the renaissance and reformation chapter (1450 CE - 1750 CE)

It spans from day 1129 to day 1158. 1 significant consecutive day milestone was reached this month. It includes:

1. Day 1150 (Halfway between 1100 and 1200)

2. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early last this month:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. This month, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before.

3. I got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and I switched on day 1, I was going to wait a week, but it was working fine, and I really wanted to get away from Windows 10. As a result, the quality of desktop screenshots has gotten close to nearly doubling, going from 1366x738 to 1920x1200 (from 738p to 1200p)

4. Starting on July 20th 2020, the mobile screenshots folder was renamed from `mobile` to `cellular` to be more technical, as my laptop is mobile as well.

5. No other notes for this month
