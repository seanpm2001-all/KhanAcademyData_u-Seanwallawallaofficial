# My September 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of September 2020.

September 2020 is my 41st consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I continued to work on World History for the entire month, making it through the current final chapter of the World History unit (20th century) for the rest of the month, from September 1st 2020 to null 2020.

It spans from day 1190 to day 1220. 1 significant consecutive day milestones was reached this month. It includes:

1. Day 1200 - (12x100)

2. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 3 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. 3 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before.

3. No other notes for this month
