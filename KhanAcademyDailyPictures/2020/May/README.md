# My May 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of May 2020.

May 2020 is my 37th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on finishing the US history unit, and starting the World History unit for the rest of the month.

It spans from day 1068 (or 1067, there might be an error) to day 1098. No unique milestone consecutive day goals were reached

This is the month before the month I began to upload my Khan Academy projects and pictures to GitHub.
