# My June 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of June 2020.

June 2020 is my 38th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on World History for the entire month, making it through the second wave civilizations chapter and starting the medievel/middle ages chapter.

It spans from day 1099 to day 1128. A unique milestone consecutive day that was reached was 1111, but also 1100.

I got daily Khan Academy screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early this month:

> Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. This month, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before.
