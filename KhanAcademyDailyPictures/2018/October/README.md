# My October 2018 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures, videos, and project files from all of October 2018.

October 2018 is my 18th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on the (unknown_unit) I need to look back into my notes to see what I did this month

It spans from day 490 to day 520, 1 unique milestone was reached this month, it includes:

> * Day 500 (Halfway to 1000)

> * No other unique milestones were reached this month

***

## Some notes

1. Starting October 7th 2018, I no longer use Google Chrome. This was the day I finally switched to Firefox

2. Day 500 was not overshadowed by Google Chrome usage

3. There were some desktop changes throughout the month. Some of them were tacky. I used ClassicShell to do this

4. No other notes for this month.
