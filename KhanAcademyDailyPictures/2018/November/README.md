# My November 2018 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures, videos, INI, and project files from all of November 2018.

November 2018 is my 19th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on the (unknown_unit) I need to look back into my notes to see what I did this month

It spans from day 521 to day 550, 2 unique milestones were reached this month, they include:

> * Day 543 (Counting down)

> * Day 550 (Halfway between 500 and 600)

> * No other unique milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. Starting on November 11th 2018, a desktop.ini file was included. This was temporary, but lasted for the rest of the month. For Windows virtual machine users, you will see a tree icon. I did this to resemble the Khan Academy logo.

2. Some of the days did not have INI files, the folders originally didn't include them

3. There were some desktop changes throughout the month. Some of them were tacky. I used ClassicShell to do this

4. The INI file doesn't fit naturally, you would need to merge all the files into the furthest folder first.

5. No other notes for this month.
