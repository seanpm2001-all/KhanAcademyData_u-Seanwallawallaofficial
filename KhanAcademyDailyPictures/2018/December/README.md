# My December 2018 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures, videos, INI, and project files from all of December 2018.

December 2018 is my 20th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on the (unknown_unit) I need to look back into my notes to see what I did this month

It spans from day 551 to day 581, 2 unique milestones were reached this month, they include:

> * Day 555 (3 5's in a row)

> * Day 567 (567 8 9, also counting)

> * No other unique milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. This month was the beginning of the PNG system, this began late in the month. The episode system was in place for most of the month, where a project file, a video file, and picture files, were included separately, along with an INI file

2. Some of the days did not have INI files, the folders originally didn't include them

3. I briefly switched to defective Acer laptop 1 during the end of this month (December 25th) but I had to switch back for a couple weeks due to a severe overheating issue

4. The INI file doesn't fit naturally, you would need to merge all the files into the furthest folder first.

5. The episode system ended this month

6. No other notes for this month.
