## Some notes

1. Starting October 7th 2018, I no longer use Google Chrome. This was the day I finally switched to Firefox. This entire month, I used Chrome, as I didn't know better at the time

2. There were some desktop changes throughout the month. Some of them were tacky. I used ClassicShell to do this

3. No other notes for this month.
