# My August 2018 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures, videos, and project files from all of August 2018.

August 2018 is my 16th consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on the (unknown_unit) I need to look back into my notes to see what I did this month

It spans from day 429 to day 459, 3 unique milestones were reached this month, they include:

> * Day 432 (Counting down from 4)

> * Day 450 (Halfway between 400 and 500)

> * Day 456 (Counting up from 4)

> * No other unique milestones were reached this month.

## Some notes

1. Starting October 7th 2018, I no longer use Google Chrome. This was the day I finally switched to Firefox. This entire month, I used Chrome, as I didn't know better at the time

2. There were some desktop changes throughout the month. Some of them were tacky. I used ClassicShell to do this

3. As of September 2nd 2020, I am unable to find the Khan Academy data for August 5th 2018 on my hard drive. I haven't checked an external drive yet, and I am hoping it is there. If not, I can recreate it.

4. No other notes for this month.
