## Some notes

1. I had an issue with the April 12th 2019 image. I was worried that the file didn't exist anymore, but I thought someone would be able to recreate it. So I went on to find the next file to work on, and it was in the same folder. The file wasn't missing after all. The file that was missing had a `(2)` after it.

2. No other notes for this month
