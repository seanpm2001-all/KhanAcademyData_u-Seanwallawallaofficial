# My January 2019 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of January 2019.

January 2019 is my 21st consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I worked on the (unknown_unit) I need to look back into my notes to see what I did this month

It spans from day 582 to day 612, 1 unique milestone was reached this month, it includes:

> * Day 600 (6/10s of a thousand)

> * No other unique milestones were reached this month

***

## Some notes

1. When uploading the files, I accidentally labeled the commit for day 585 as day 584. The first instance of 584 is correct (the one labeled `Actually`) the other one is actually 585. I can't edit commit titles, and I don't want to, so please make note of this.

2. I switched to a new laptop on the 12th of January. One very notable way of telling this is how it goes from an awesome layout to a lame one.

3. No other notes for this month.
