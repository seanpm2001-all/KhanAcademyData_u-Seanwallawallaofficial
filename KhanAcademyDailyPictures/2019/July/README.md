## Some notes

1. Khan Academy had a redesign on July 23rd 2019. As of July 26th 2020, this is the current design. I don't like it very much.

2. I had to change my Firefox theme on July 9th 2019 due to the theme becoming incompatible with the recent Firefox update (Firefox 68.0)

3. No other notes
