# Version 1.01 (June 10th 2020)

I have decided to take a 180 on the "end of support" thing, as a couple hours after that announcement, I have decided to completely re-purpose this project, and I did. The new purpose is to serve as an archive for my daily Khan Academy screenshots, and I have started to add them in.

In this update, I have added:

> * Khan Academy screenshots and ZIP data for April 27th 2020 to June 10th 2020

This is all I have done. I hope to find a solution for the location bug soon without having to move everything manually.

I currently sit at 1108 consecutive days on Khan Academy.
