# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.0.2

This is the 3rd release of my Khan Academy archive. It is complete in one way, but far from complete in the other. For Khan Academy scripts, all of them have been imported, but for daily screenshots, I mostly only have uploaded the June 2020 ones.

I am taking a break at the moment, and finalizing this update. This update:

> * Adds a README.md file for the June 2020 folder

> * Deletes all unnecessary README.md files for June 2020

> * Adds in Khan Academy data from June 11th to June 19th 2020, and also adds in blank directories for the rest of the month
