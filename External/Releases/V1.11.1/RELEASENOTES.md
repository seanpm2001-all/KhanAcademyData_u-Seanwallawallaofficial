# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.11.1

## V1.11.1

### About

This is the 22nd release of my Khan Academy archive. I spent about half an hour on this update, a lot less time than the previous update. I had to change the version number, so it would go to the top of the tags in the last release. It succeeded, so I am continuing doing this. This update is a side update to 1.11.

This is what I did for this update:

> * Deleted some unnecessary `IGNORE.md` files from 2017

> * Deleted the `IGNORE.md` files from the last 4 days of July 2020

> * Deleted `IGNORE.md` files from the December 2018 archive

This update took less time to make, and finalizes the changes in the last update, along with adding some new ones. I was originally considering holding off most of the work for the deletion of template December 2018 files for tomorrow, but I decided to just wrap up work today instead.
