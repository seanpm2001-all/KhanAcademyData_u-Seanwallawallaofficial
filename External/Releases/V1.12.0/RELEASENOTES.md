# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.12.0

## V1.12.0

### About

This is the 23rd release of my Khan Academy archive. I spent over half the month on this update, as I didn't have enough dedicated time for this project.

This is what I did for this update:

> * Added images, videos, project files, and INI files for the November 2018 archive

> * Added a README file for the November 2018 archive

> * Added images and zip files for August 1st to August 20th 2020.

I finally released this update. It took a long time.
