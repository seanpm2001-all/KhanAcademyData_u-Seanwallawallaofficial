# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.1.10.1

## V1.1.10.1

### About

This is the 20th release of my Khan Academy archive. This is a side update to 1.0.10. I had to change the version number, so it would go to the top of the tags. I am hoping this will work.

This is what I did for this update:

> * Deleted 127 `IGNORE.md` files from the January, February, March, and April 2019, and July 27th 2020 picture archives

> * Updated the April 2019 README file to V2

> * Updated the Acronym list to V2

> * Updated the July 2020 README file to V2

> * No other changes in this update.
