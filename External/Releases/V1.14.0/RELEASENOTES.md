### About

This is the 27th release of my Khan Academy archive. I spent 3 days on this update.

This is what I did for this update:

> * Added images, videos, and project files for the September 2018 archive

> * Added a README file for the September 2018 archive

> * Added images and zip files for August 30th to August 31st 2020.

> * Moved the ProjectWiki to the `/External/` directory

> * Added the new releases section

> * No other changes in this release

I finally released this update. It took a few days, as I held off some work.
