### About

This is the 4th release of my Khan Academy archive. I have done a lot in this update, but decided to wrap up for now. This is the first update in nearly a whole month.

This is what I did for this update:

> * Adds a README.md file for the July 2020 folder and April 2020 folders

> * Adds in Khan Academy data from June 20th to June 30th 2020, and also from July  1st 2020 to July 15th 2020, plus April 1st 2020 to April 22nd 2020

> * Added the *.txt file extension to the GNU GPL3 license.
