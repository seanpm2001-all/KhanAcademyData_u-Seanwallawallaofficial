# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.11.0

## V1.11.0

### About

This is the 21st release of my Khan Academy archive. I spent several days on this update, along with several hours of time. I had to change the version number, so it would go to the top of the tags, the previous 2 versions didn't. 1.10.x was actually the last 2 releases. I am hoping this will work this time.

This is what I did for this update:

> * Added in pictures and zip files for July 28th, July 29th, July 30th, and July 31st 2020

> * Added in IGNORE.md files for most of 2018

> * Added in media for December 2018

> * Started the structure for August 2020

> * Added some README files for 2017, May 28th to June 4th

This update took several days to make, and is a release with the most commits to date. This is also the first update of August 2020.
